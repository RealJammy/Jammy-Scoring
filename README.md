# Jammy-Scoring

A dynamic scoring system to be used in CTFs and other competitions.

It is described in more detail in ![the Jammy Scoring paper](Jammy_Scoring.pdf), but the system revolves around challenge point values increasing until a blood, where it stays fixed forever.

If there are any suggestions or tweaks to be made to Jammy Scoring, please let me know!
